"""number = 2: We start with a variable called number set to 2. This is where 
we'll begin. while True <= 30:: This line means we'll keep doing the following as 
long as "True" (which always evaluates as true) is less than or equal to 30. It's
 a way of saying, "Keep doing this until we reach 30." if number % 2 == 0:: Here, 
 we check if the current value of number is even. The % operator calculates the 
 remainder when dividing number by 2. If the remainder is 0, it means number is 
 even. print(number): If number is even (the condition is true), we print the 
 value of number. number += 1: After printing, we add 1 to the value of 
 number, so we move on to the next number. So, this code starts at 2 and keeps 
 printing even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) one at a time until it reaches or 
 exceeds 30. It increments the number by 1 in each iteration to check the next 
 number."""
