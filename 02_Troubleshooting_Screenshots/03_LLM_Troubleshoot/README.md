# 🧠 AI Output Troubleshooting Log

This folder contains visual debugging records related to the **AI Memory Parser**, including file watcher triggers, `.md` to `.json` conversions, path monitoring, and parsing events. These screenshots capture key outputs and issues observed during the development and refinement of the persistent memory system.

_This capture shows:_
- Real-time parsing of Markdown memory logs
- Output written to `.parsed.json`
- Emotional + semantic analysis being extracted from entries
- GUI + CLI + file explorer cross-view of synced outputs

## 🗃️ Folder Purpose

- Store screenshots related to **parsed memory file handling**, **watcher automation**, and **AI-driven file transformation**.
- Visual aid for debugging: PowerShell outputs, Python errors, file writes, or entry format bugs.
- Supports documentation across `scripts/memory_parser.py`, `memory_watcher.py`, and `parsed_memory/`.

## 🔗 Related System Modules

- `memory_parser.py` — Responsible for converting `.md` entries into dual-format `.json` logs.
- `memory_watcher.py` — Watches folders in real time and triggers parsing when new files are added or edited.
- `99_System_Settings/parsed_memory/` — Folder shown in screenshots; contains all resulting structured output.
