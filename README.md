# AMA `-` AI Memory Architecture🧠

> A modular AI system that reflects, summarizes, and stylizes your memory — using local language models chained together in a persistent, privacy-first pipeline. Using my personal or test made `md` files, feeding them in via my custom made `router.py`, while being stored in a Obsidian Vault.

## 🔍 What It Does

* Watches `.md` logs for changes and parses them into structured `.json`
* Routes parsed memory through a **multi-model LLM chain**:

  * 🤍 Capybara → tags & emotions
  * 🧠 Hermes → summary metadata
  * 🎭 MythoMax → Markdown stylization
* Optionally pipes output into TTS (e.g., ElevenLabs) or future dashboards

## 🧠 Memory Watcher Demo (30s)

In this short clip, I’m showing a key piece of my personal AI memory system: a background “watcher” that notices when I update a note — and then automatically transforms that update into structured memory.

### What you’re seeing:
- I start the watcher (a small Python script always running in the background)
- I make a quick change to one of my `.md` memory files
- That change is instantly picked up and parsed into a clean `.json` format
- I open the `.json` file to show that the updated content is now saved in a structured, machine-readable format

Even though it’s a short clip, this small process is the backbone of a much bigger system — one where every note, thought, or reflection can be turned into searchable memory for future use in AI workflows.

## 🧠 AI Memory Workflow Showcase

This section visually documents the real-time behavior of the local AI memory system — from journal creation to model parsing and multi-step inference. Each screenshot shows a critical step in how memory is detected, routed, and transformed by local language models in a modular chain.

---

### 1. ✍️ Memory Entry Logged

![Memory Entry](./docs/images/Screenshot-2025-07-12-035005.png)  
A journal entry (`.md`) is created in `memory_core/02_Training_&_Discipline`. This triggers the `memory_watcher.py`, which detects file changes automatically.

---

### 2. 🔁 Watcher + Parser Activated

![Watcher Trigger](./docs/images/Screenshot-2025-07-12-040512.png)  
The file watcher logs activity: detecting the new `.md` file, parsing it, and routing it through the `router_sequence.json`. Parsed `.json` and `.parsed.md` files are generated and stored.

---

### 3. 🧠 Multi-Model Inference Begins

![Model Chaining](./docs/images/Screenshot-2025-07-12-114321.png)  
The pipeline routes the parsed memory through 3 local LLMs:
- **Capybara** extracts emotions + tags  
- **Hermes** generates semantic summaries  
- **MythoMax** stylizes and enhances the final `.md` narrative  

Each model runs in its own session with detailed log output.

---

### 4. 📄 Structured Output Produced

![Parsed JSON Output](./docs/images/Screenshot-2025-07-12-202332.png)  
A `.parsed.json` is created with tags, tone, meaning, and quotes — plus a stylized Markdown file showing the enhanced narrative. This allows both human and machine-readable outputs to coexist.

---

### 5. ⚠️ Error Handling (Capybara Timeout)

![Model Error & Fallback](./docs/images/Screenshot-2025-07-12-213427.png)  
If a model fails (e.g., no valid JSON from MythoMax), the system logs a warning and continues with a fallback. This ensures resilience and recovery without manual intervention.

> This memory pipeline is fully offline and modular — a living architecture that turns raw thought into structured cognition. Built entirely with local tools.

## 📆 Example Output

```json
{
  "title": "First Encounter with Memory Core",
  "summary": "Reflective log capturing emotional tension and resolve.",
  "tags": ["memory", "emotion", "introspection"],
  "emotions": {"calm": 0.6, "anxious": 0.4}
}
```
