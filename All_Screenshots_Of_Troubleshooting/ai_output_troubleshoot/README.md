## 🗃️ Folder Purpose

- Store screenshots related to **parsed memory file handling**, **watcher automation**, and **AI-driven file transformation**.
- Visual aid for debugging: PowerShell outputs, Python errors, file writes, or entry format bugs.
- Supports documentation across `scripts/memory_parser.py`, `memory_watcher.py`, and `parsed_memory/`.

## 🔗 Related System Modules

- `memory_parser.py` — Responsible for converting `.md` entries into dual-format `.json` logs.
- `memory_watcher.py` — Watches folders in real time and triggers parsing when new files are added or edited.
- `99_System_Settings/parsed_memory/` — Folder shown in screenshots; contains all resulting structured output.
