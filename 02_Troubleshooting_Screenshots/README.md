# AMA – Troubleshooting Gallery

This folder contains categorized screenshots documenting real-time debugging, testing, and implementation efforts across my local AI memory system.

Each subfolder reflects a core system component, including prompt outputs, parser flows, Gradio UI testing, and automation using `n8n`.

## 📁 Folder Breakdown

- **ai_output_troubleshoot** – Screenshots of parsed `.json` memory files, emotion tagging, and prompt-based formatting from Obsidian logs.

These visual logs are part of a broader architecture for:
- Memory persistence and injection
- Multi-model orchestration (Capybara, Hermes, MythoMax)
